Because Credible is a marketplace rather than a lender, the lender that underwrites your loan—not Credible—determines the fees and repayment options.
Loan Fees

None of Credible’s partners charge application fees, origination fees, or prepayment penalties.7 But there may be late fees or returned payment fees.
Loan Discounts

Some of Credible’s partners offer special discounts, such as autopay discounts. With some lenders, you can qualify for a 0.25% interest rate reduction by enrolling in automatic payments, or get additional discounts by showing proof of graduation or taking out multiple loans.
