Through Credible, borrowers can find private student loans to pay for undergraduate or graduate degrees. Parents borrowing to pay for a child’s college education can also find a loan through Credible’s platform. 

Although loan eligibility requirements can vary by lender, Credible’s partners typically require borrowers to meet the following criteria: 

Students must be enrolled at least part-time
You must be the age of majority in your state or have a co-signer
Students must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents; international students may qualify for a loan if they have a creditworthy co-signer who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident
